				<h2>Hi! I'm PiggyClone205!</h2>
				<p>My name will not be revealed, as that would compromise my web identity. Anyways, this is my game website.</p>
				<p>I also have some images and audio works on this site, and you can email me through the email page! Have fun, and stay <span style=";color: #ffd700;">gold!</span></p>

				<h2>Hi! I'm Techcraft7!</h2>
				<p>My name will also not be revealed, as with PiggyClone205.  I am just some other person contributing to this website.  I fixed a visual bug when the sticky navigation bar activates.</p>
